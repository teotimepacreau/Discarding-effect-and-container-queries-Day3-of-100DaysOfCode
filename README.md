# Project goal

- discarding effect with translateX + rotate + scale
- enabling dynamic and adaptive styling with container queries (the card change its layout based on it's own size)
- position relative and position absolute to create the top left icon
- border-radius container handle with images thanks to "overflow: hidden"
- images taking up all parent thanks to Flexbox
- input styling with ellipsis to avoid text overflow
- CSS animation + transition to give it the smooth effect
- hover-effect
- Flexbox to create component and align + Grid for the general UI
